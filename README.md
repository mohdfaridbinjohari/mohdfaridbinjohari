Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.

Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

Screenshot of the README file in the GitHub Docs open source repository with the drop-down menu for the table of contents exposed. The table of contents icon is outlined in dark orange.

Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Style	Syntax	Keyboard shortcut	Example	Output
Bold	** ** or __ __	Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux)	**This is bold text**	This is bold text
Italic	* * or _ _     	Command+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux)	_This text is italicized_	This text is italicized
Strikethrough	~~ ~~	None	~~This was mistaken text~~	This was mistaken text
Bold and nested italic	** ** and _ _	None	**This text is _extremely_ important**	This text is extremely important
All bold and italic	*** ***	None	***All this text is important***	All this text is important
Subscript	<sub> </sub>	None	This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text	This is a subscript text
Superscript	<sup> </sup>	None	This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text	This is a superscript text
Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
Quoted text is indented, with a different type color.

Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing sample quoted text. The quote is indented with a vertical line on the left, and its text is dark gray rather than black.

Note: When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Keyboard shortcuts."

Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing the appearance of characters surrounded by backticks. The words "git status" appear in a fixed-width typeface, highlighted in light gray.

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

For more information, see "Creating and highlighting code blocks."

If you are frequently editing code snippets and tables, you may benefit from enabling a fixed-width font in all comment fields on GitHub. For more information, see "About writing and formatting on GitHub."

Supported color models
In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.
Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how HEX values within backticks create small circles of color. #ffffff shows a white circle, and #000000 shows a black circle.

Here are the currently supported color models.

Color	Syntax	Example	Output
HEX	`#RRGGBB`	`#0969DA`	Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how HEX value #0969DA appears with a blue circle.
RGB	`rgb(R,G,B)`	`rgb(9, 105, 218)`	Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how RGB value 9, 105, 218 appears with a blue circle.
HSL	`hsl(H,S,L)`	`hsl(212, 92%, 45%)`	Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how HSL value 212, 92%, 45% appears with a blue circle.
Notes:

A supported color model cannot have any leading or trailing spaces within the backticks.
The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

You can also create a Markdown hyperlink by highlighting the text and using the keyboard shortcut Command+V. If you'd like to replace the text with the link, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+V.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Screenshot of rendered GitHub Markdown showing how text within brackets, "GitHub Pages," appears as a blue hyperlink.

Note: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

Section links
You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose .

Screenshot of a README for a repository. To the left of a section heading, a link icon is outlined in dark orange.

Relative links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. The path of the link will be relative to the current file. Links starting with / will be relative to the repository root. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.

Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

Images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

GitHub supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image. For more information, see "Uploading assets."

Note: When you want to display an image that is in your repository, use relative links instead of absolute links.

Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.

Context	Relative Link
In a .md file on the same branch	/assets/images/electrocat.png
In a .md file on another branch	/../main/assets/images/electrocat.png
In issues, pull requests and comments of the repository	../blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true
In a .md file in another repository	/../../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png
In issues, pull requests and comments of another repository	../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed. that is a quote
